#### Features

- 6 Programmable  Macro Buttons
- 128x64 OLED display for button labels and Icons
- Support for up to 256 profiles for a total of 1536 Macros!
- Easy XML configuration, no special drivers required!
- Macro button combinations can be configured with up to 3 simultaneous buttons or 3 seperate button presses with configurable delays between them.
- Micro SD Storage for button labels and config files.
- Haptic feedback mouse wheel with three different modes. Clicky, Twist and Momentum
- RGB ring with configurable colours and 5 different display modes. Halo, Bands, Breath, Rainbow, Solid and Off.
- Easy profile switching with up down profile buttons or profile list display.

### Printing Instructions

#### - Printed version
Print all files in the 3D Files/STL's folder. You will need 6 of the keycap file, two of the Menu button file and two of the PCB spacer file.


#### - Machined Version
Print all files in the 3D Files/STL's folder except: "Custom Keycap.STL", "Macro Pad - Printed Version.STL" and "Menu Button Printed.STL"
Get all of the .STEP files in the 3D Files/STEP folder machined. Don't include the Macropad Assembly .STEP file from the main directory as it is a complete model of Macro Pad rather than an individual part. If you supply the MacroPad Housing.PDF file with the housing, you can have the mounting holes tapped for you.

### Motor Assembly

I made this quick picture to show how the wheel motor gets assembled:

![Alt text](MotorStack.png "Motor Assembly")

The "Encoder Mount.STL" part has two small holes in it that are supposed to get tapped to M2 for the encoder. If you don't have an M2 tap, you can probably just glue the encoder to the mount or even use some small self tapping screws to hold it in place.

The magnet holder should be a snug fit inside the hollow motor shaft. If it isn't, I'd recomend a drop of super glue to ensure it can't work free over time.

#### Software

The software is still a work in progress. Everything is functional currently, but I'm sure I will have missed some bugs as I've only had time to do some limited testing so far. I will work on clearing as many bugs as I can in the coming weeks but let me know if you run into any! If you're going to submit an issue with a bug, please try and recount your steps to re-create the bug as it will make fixing it much easier!

If you don't wish to compile the code yourself, just copy the latest version of the MacroPad.UF2 file from the software folder and install it directly onto the memory of your Pico using the boot method shown in the video.

You will also need to have your SD card set up correctly in order to use the macro pad.
Copy the entire contents of the "Example SD Card" folder onto you SD card to begin with to ensure everything is working before you start working on your own files.


#### XML Config

In the `<Settings>` tag of the XML file you will find all of the settings for the LED's, along with the P and I tuning values for the various wheel modes.

There are 6 acceptable inpts for the `<LED_Mode>` tag. If you spell the words incorrectly the commands won't work, so it would be a good idea to copy and paste from here:

Breath, Bands, Halo, Rainbow, Solid, Off

`<LED_Primary>` and `<LED_Secondary>` are the two colours used in the effects and they are formatted in the order of Red, Green and Blue with values between 0-255. Rainbow and Off obviously don't make use of these colour options and solid just sets the colour to `<LED_Primary>` and ignores `<LED_Secondary>`.

The motor tuning for the printed version of the wheel should be pretty good, so try with my default P and I values first before you do any tuning. I've left out D from the tuning options as it doesn't seem to be needed for this type of feedback and just makes tuning more complex.

In the `<Profiles>` tag is where each profile is stored.

Each profile starts off with a name value assigned like this: `<Profile name="Solidworks">`
Then, there is a `<WheelMode>` and `<WheelKey>` tag. `<WheelKey>` can be any key value from this website https://keycode-visualizer.netlify.app/ and will be held down when the wheel is moving. `<WheelMode>` can only be one of three things: Clicky, Twist or Momentum. Again, these have to be exact so copy and paste from here to ensure they work.

Next is a `<MacroButtons>` tag that holds all of our Macro buttons for the profile.

Each macro button looks like this: 
```
<MacroButton>
    <Action>0,68</Action>
    <Action>0,0</Action>
    <Action>0,0</Action>
    <Label>Dimension</Label>
</MacroButton>
```
There will be 6 of these sections per profile. Each action has two values, the first is the delay (in milliseconds) to perform before the action, followed by the keycode you wish to press (using the same website I linked earlier). Setting both of these values to 0 for any of the three actions will mean nothing happens for that action.
Label is simply the name that will appear on screen for that button.

And that's it! just replicate that first example profile as many times as you like (up to 256 times, anyway) and each one will create a new profile that you can store your macros in.
